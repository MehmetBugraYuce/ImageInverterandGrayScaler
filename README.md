# ImageInverterandGrayScaler
Xilinx VHDL RTL schematics have black backgrounds, to make the background white we invert the image then grayscale it so it can be used in lab reports and in published texts. Created mainly for personal use.

To use one can simply download the .exe file
Double clicking on the file will ask you to choose your images
Then the program will ask for output folder
The inverted and then grayscaled images will appear on the output folde with _inv_gs at the end of file name

Used UPX to reduce .exe size to 22mb from 29mb(no UPX)
I used tkinter and PIL libraries.
This code is the end result of "VIBE" Coding
Further improvements could easily be made

A simple program that can invert,grayscale,flip,lighten,darken image can be easily made.
Since that required a GUI i didn't want to move on

Students of Hacettepe University who take ELE227 course may use this as it shortens the required processes.
